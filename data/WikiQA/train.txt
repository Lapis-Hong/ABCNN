0	who rules communism government	Technically , `` communist state '' is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless .

0	who rules communism government	Historically , a `` communist state '' referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party -run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ; today , a communist state can also , for instance , refer to contemporary China and Vietnam , where a Communist Party-run state exists alongside a mixed economy .

0	who rules communism government	Consequently , the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined , such as in the development of parallel institutions .
0	who rules communism government	In the 20th century , most communist states adopted planned economies .

0	who rules communism government	In the 21st century , China and Vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to develop .
0	who rules communism government	The fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop .
0	who rules communism government	As a result , many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these states .

0	what is water jet propulsion	A rider on a Yamaha Waverunner XL performing a high-speed turn .
0	what is water jet propulsion	A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft .
1	what is water jet propulsion	Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat , a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat , then expels it through a nozzle at the stern .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton ( who developed a waterjet in 1954 ) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand , specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes , generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Unlike these previous waterjet developments , such as Campini 's and the Hanley Hydrojet , Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water , and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution .
0	what is water jet propulsion	From this , the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Through further developments , it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types , and as such , waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels , including passenger ferries , rescue craft , patrol boats and offshore supply vessels .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Jetboats are highly maneuverable , and many can , from full speed , be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length , in a maneuver known as a `` crash stop '' .
0	what is water jet propulsion	The well known Hamilton turn or `` jet spin '' is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat 's engine throttle is cut , the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again , causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water .
0	what is water jet propulsion	There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats , though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds , up to about , but as boat speed increases beyond this , the extra hull resistance generated by struts , rudders , shafts ( etc . ) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range ( up to ) .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Also , in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds ( such as tug boats ) , the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical .
0	what is water jet propulsion	For these reasons , the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught , maneuverability , and load flexibility are main concerns .
0	what is water jet propulsion	The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger/car ferry industry .
0	what is water jet propulsion	South Africa 's s ( approximately long ) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far .
0	what is water jet propulsion	Even these German-built vessels are capable of performing `` crash stops '' .

0	what is scurvy disease	As scurvy advances , there can be open , suppurating wounds , loss of teeth , jaundice , fever , neuropathy and death .
0	what is scurvy disease	Scurvy was at one time common among sailors , pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored ( subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods .
0	what is scurvy disease	It was described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c . 380 BC ) , and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory .
0	what is scurvy disease	Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel , often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages .
0	what is scurvy disease	This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century , continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century .
0	what is scurvy disease	While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency , until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932 , numerous theories and treatments were proposed , often on little or no experimental data .
0	what is scurvy disease	This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept , an inability to reliably link different foods ( notably present in fresh citrus , watercress , and organ meat ) to scurvy .
0	what is scurvy disease	An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron , thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time .
0	what is scurvy disease	Treatment by fresh food , particularly citrus fruit , was periodically implemented , as it had been since antiquity .
0	what is scurvy disease	However until the 1930s , treatment was inconsistent , with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century .
0	what is scurvy disease	It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy , James Lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book , A Treatise of the Scurvy , though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades .
0	what is scurvy disease	In infants , scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's disease , named after Sir Thomas Barlow , a British physician who described it .
0	what is scurvy disease	However , Barlow 's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse .
0	what is scurvy disease	Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease .
0	what is scurvy disease	Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C .
0	what is scurvy disease	However , humans and other higher primates ( the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers ) , guinea pigs , most or all bats , and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet .
0	what is scurvy disease	Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues , with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits ) , tomatoes , potatoes , cabbages , and green peppers .

1	what is middle class in the us	Depending on class model used , the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25 % to 66 % of households .
0	what is middle class in the us	One of the first major studies of the middle class in America was White Collar : The American Middle Classes , published in 1951 by sociologist C. Wright Wright_Mills Mills Wright_Mills .
0	what is middle class in the us	Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups .
1	what is middle class in the us	Constituting roughly 15 % to 20 % of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated , salaried professionals and managers .
0	what is middle class in the us	Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals , skilled craftsmen and lower-level management .

0	when monopoly came out	The five sets of the board game Monopoly depicted here show the evolution of the game 's artwork and designs in the United States from 1935–2005 .
0	when monopoly came out	The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century .
1	when monopoly came out	The earliest known design was by the American , Elizabeth Magie , patented in 1904 but existing as early as 1902 .
0	when monopoly came out	Magie 's original intent was to publish a board game to illustrate an economic principle , namely the Georgist concept of a single land value tax .
0	when monopoly came out	A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land .
0	when monopoly came out	By 1934 , a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century , and into the 21st .
0	when monopoly came out	Several people , mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast , contributed to the game 's design and evolution .
0	when monopoly came out	By the 1970s , the idea that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore ; it was printed in the game 's instructions for many years , in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly , and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007 .
0	when monopoly came out	Even a guide to family games published for Reader 's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie , erroneously stating that Magie 's original game was created in the 1800s , and not acknowledging any of the game 's development between Magie 's creation of the game , and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers .
0	when monopoly came out	Also in the 1970s , Professor Ralph Anspach , who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and trust busting , fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company , General Mills , over the trademarks of the Monopoly board game .

0	when monopoly came out	Anspach confronted Maxine Brady , author of the 1974 book The Monopoly Book : Strategy and Tactics of the World 's Most Popular Game over the actual history of the game on Barry Farber 's New York City talk show in 1975 .
0	when monopoly came out	Because of the lengthy court process , including appeals , the legal status of Parker Brothers ' trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985 .
0	when monopoly came out	The game 's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers , as do its specific design elements .
0	when monopoly came out	At the conclusion of the court case , the game 's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger Monopoly brand , licensed by Parker Brothers ' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day .
0	when monopoly came out	Despite the `` rediscovery '' of the board game 's early history in the 1970s and 1980s , and several books and journal articles on the subject , Hasbro ( Parker Brothers ' current parent company ) did not acknowledge any of the game 's history before Charles Darrow on its official Monopoly website as recently as June 2012 .
0	when monopoly came out	Nor did Hasbro acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them , at least as recently as 2006 .
0	when monopoly came out	International tournaments , first held in the early 1970s , continue to the present , with the next world championship likely scheduled for 2013 .

0	when monopoly came out	Since 1994 , many official variants of the game , based on locations other than Atlantic City , New Jersey ( the official U.S. setting ) or London ( the official Commonwealth setting , excepting Canada ) , have been published by Hasbro or its licensees .

0	who invented the internet	The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s .
1	who invented the internet	The public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the Internet when a message was sent over the ARPANet from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock 's laboratory at University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , after the second piece of network equipment was installed at Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) .
0	who invented the internet	Packet switched networks such as ARPANET , Mark I at NPL in the UK , CYCLADES , Merit Network , Tymnet , and Telenet , were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols .
0	who invented the internet	The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking , in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks .
0	who invented the internet	In 1982 , the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was standardized , and consequently , the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected TCP/IP networks , called the Internet , was introduced .
0	who invented the internet	Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) developed the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) and again in 1986 when NSFNET provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations .

1	what are use taxes ?	A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means , if you buy a Taxable product/services without paying any Sales tax to vendor , you owe use tax .
0	what are use taxes ?	You must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered .
0	what are use taxes ?	Use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item ( without paying sales tax ) and store it in your warehouse initially , use tax applies to that location where goods were stored .
0	what are use taxes ?	Later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location , you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption .
0	what are use taxes ?	This really means that you do n't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction .
0	what are use taxes ?	It is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable products/services .
0	what are use taxes ?	If vendor does n't charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate Jurisdication .
0	what are use taxes ?	Use Tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of Sales Tax but in some states the tax rate is different .
1	what are use taxes ?	Use tax is also termed as `` Consumption Tax '' or `` Consumer Use Tax '' .
1	what are use taxes ?	A use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments .
0	what are use taxes ?	It is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use , storage , or consumption in that state ( not for resale ) , regardless of where the purchase took place .
0	what are use taxes ?	If a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state , full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction .
0	what are use taxes ?	The use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home state 's sales tax .
0	what are use taxes ?	Usually , this is due to out-of-state purchases , as well as ordering items through the mail , by phone , or over the Internet from other states .
0	what are use taxes ?	The use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed ( if any ) had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence .
0	what are use taxes ?	For example , a resident of Massachusetts , with a 6.25 % `` sales and use tax '' on certain goods and services , purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use , storage or other consumption in Massachusetts .
0	what are use taxes ?	Under New Hampshire law , the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods , but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25 % of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax .
0	what are use taxes ?	If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase , whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted ( as a tax credit ) from the 6.25 % owed for subsequent use , storage or consumption in Massachusetts .
0	what are use taxes ?	With few exceptions , no state 's vendors will charge the native state 's sales tax on goods shipped out of state , meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax .
0	what are use taxes ?	The purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods .
0	what are use taxes ?	The assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually , but some states require a monthly payment .
0	what are use taxes ?	For example , where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6 % sales tax on property brought in for use in the state , Vermont law requires filing a tax return ( Form SU-452 and payment ) by the 20th day of the month following non-exempt purchases to avoid a $ 50 late fee , a 5 % penalty per month , to a maximum of 25 % , plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penalties .
0	what are use taxes ?	Typical exemptions include purchases by charitable non-profit organizations or governmental agencies , purchases for resale in commerce , and purchases via `` casual sales '' by individuals not in the ordinary course of business .
0	what are use taxes ?	Also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the U.S. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable .
0	what are use taxes ?	As an illustration of the complexities : a 2006 Massachusetts law requires payment of tax on `` pre-written '' ( not custom ) software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for installation and use in Massachusetts , regardless of where it originates .
0	what are use taxes ?	However , the actual use of the same software downloaded by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed `` service '' .
0	what are use taxes ?	In contrast , Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet ( such as downloaded software or music ) , except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable `` telecommunications services '' .
0	what are use taxes ?	Software ( pre-written or custom ) `` delivered thru a tangible medium '' ( i.e. , on disk ) in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online , except `` custom software for a particular customer '' which is non-taxable `` programming services '' even if delivered on a disk .
0	what are use taxes ?	In most cases , this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws ; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location , remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every US state and locality that assesses them , if the company has a presence or `` nexus '' in every state ( as large `` brick-and-mortar '' sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do ) .

0	how many percent is a basis point	The same unit is also ( rarely ) called a permyriad , literally meaning 'for ( every ) myriad ( ten thousand ) ' , and in that context is written with which looks like a percent sign ( % ) with two extra zeroes at the end ( like a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator , although it originates as a natural extension of the percent ( % ) and permille ( ‰ ) signs ) .
0	how many percent is a basis point	A basis point is defined as:
1	how many percent is a basis point	1 basis point = 1 permyriad = one one-hundredth percent
1	how many percent is a basis point	1 bp = 1 = 0.01 % = 0.1‰ = 10−4 = = 0.0001

0	how many percent is a basis point	Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1 % are discussed .
0	how many percent is a basis point	The most common example is interest rates , where differences in interest rates of less than 1 % per year are usually meaningful to talk about .
0	how many percent is a basis point	For example , a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points ( e.g . a 4.67 % rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77 % ) .
0	how many percent is a basis point	Like percentage points , basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate .

0	what does the universal law of gravitation state	Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton 's law of gravitation
1	what does the universal law of gravitation state	Newton 's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them .
0	what does the universal law of gravitation state	( Separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers . )
0	what does the universal law of gravitation state	This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Newton called induction .
0	what does the universal law of gravitation state	It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton 's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` the Principia '' ) , first published on 5 July 1687 .
0	what does the universal law of gravitation state	( When Newton 's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society , Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him – see History section below . )
0	what does the universal law of gravitation state	In modern language , the law states the following:

1	what makes a dwarf planet	More explicitly , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun that is massive enough for its shape to be controlled by gravitation , but that unlike a planet has not cleared its orbital region of other objects .
0	what makes a dwarf planet	The term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the Sun , brought about by an increase in discoveries of trans-Neptunian objects that rivaled Pluto in size , and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object , Eris .
0	what makes a dwarf planet	This classification states that bodies large enough to have cleared the neighbourhood of their orbit are defined as planets , while those that are not massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity are defined as small Solar System bodies .

0	what makes a dwarf planet	The IAU currently recognizes five dwarf planets in the Solar System : , Pluto , , , and .
0	what makes a dwarf planet	However , only two of these bodies , Ceres and Pluto , have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they fit the definition .
0	what makes a dwarf planet	Eris has been accepted as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto .
0	what makes a dwarf planet	The IAU subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 ( and hence a diameter of ≥838 km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1 ) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets .

1	what are four thirds cameras	The Four Thirds system is a standard created by Olympus and Kodak for digital single-lens reflex camera ( DSLR ) design and development. < ref name='DPReview.com 2001-02-13 ' >
0	what are four thirds cameras	The system provides a standard that , with digital cameras and lenses available from multiple manufacturers , allows for the interchange of lenses and bodies from different manufacturers .
0	what are four thirds cameras	seems to cover the standard .
0	what are four thirds cameras	Proponents describe it as an open standard , but companies may only use it under a non-disclosure agreement .
0	what are four thirds cameras	Unlike older SLR systems , Four Thirds has been designed from the ground up to be entirely digital .
0	what are four thirds cameras	Many lenses are extensively computerized , to the point that Olympus offers firmware updates for many of them .
0	what are four thirds cameras	Lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors , most notably through telecentric designs .
0	what are four thirds cameras	The size of the sensor is significantly smaller than for most DSLRs and this implies that lenses , especially telephoto lenses , can be smaller .
0	what are four thirds cameras	For example , a Four Thirds lens with a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard , and is correspondingly more compact .
0	what are four thirds cameras	Thus , the Four Thirds System has crop factor ( focal length multiplier ) of about 2 , and while this enables longer focal length for greater magnification , it does n't aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses .
0	what are four thirds cameras	The image sensor format , generally intermediate between those of larger SLRs and smaller compact cameras , generally gives levels of cost , performance and convenience intermediate between those two classes .

0	what are rocker arms ?	Rocker arm
1	what are rocker arms ?	Generally referred to within the context of the internal combustion engine of automotive , marine , motorcycle and reciprocating aviation engines , the rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it .
0	what are rocker arms ?	One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft ( either directly or via a tappet ( lifter ) and pushrod ) while the other end acts on the valve stem .
0	what are rocker arms ?	When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm , the inside presses down on the valve stem , opening the valve .
0	what are rocker arms ?	When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation , the inside rises , allowing the valve spring to close the valve .
0	what are rocker arms ?	The drive cam is driven by the camshaft .
0	what are rocker arms ?	This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaft .
0	what are rocker arms ?	Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller cam follower .
0	what are rocker arms ?	A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller cam follower to a second rocker arm .

0	what are rocker arms ?	In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head .
0	what are rocker arms ?	The effective leverage of the arm ( and thus the force it can exert on the valve stem ) is determined by the rocker arm ratio , the ratio of the distance from the rocker arm 's center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod .
0	what are rocker arms ?	Current automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1 .
0	what are rocker arms ?	However , in the past smaller positive ratios ( the valve lift is greater than the cam lift ) and even negative ratios ( valve lift smaller than the cam lift ) have been used .
0	what are rocker arms ?	Many pre-WW2 engines use 1:1 ( neutral ) ratios .
0	what are rocker arms ?	For car engines the rocker arms are generally steel stampings , providing a reasonable balance of strength , weight and economical cost .

1	what caused ww	The causes of World War I , which began in central Europe in late July 1914 and finished in 1918 , included many factors , such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war .
0	what caused ww	Militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well .
0	what caused ww	The immediate origins of the war , however , lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the Crisis of 1914 , casus belli for which was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the Archduke of Austria Hungary ) and his wife Sophie by Gavrilo Princip , an irredentist Serb .
0	what caused ww	The crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers ( Italy , France , Germany , the British Empire , the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia ) over European and colonial issues in the decade before 1914 that had left tensions high .
0	what caused ww	In turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1867 .
0	what caused ww	The more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the Balkans .
0	what caused ww	Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the Great Powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .
0	what caused ww	Although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between the various European powers since 1870 .
0	what caused ww	Some of the most important long term or structural causes are : the growth of nationalism across Europe , unresolved territorial disputes , an intricate system of alliances , the perceived breakdown of the balance of power in Europe , convoluted and fragmented governance , the arms races of the previous decades , previous military planning , imperial and colonial rivalry for wealth , power and prestige , and economic and military rivalry in industry and trade – e.g. , the Pig War between Austria and Serbia .
0	what caused ww	Other causes that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent ( e.g. , the German belief that the United Kingdom would remain neutral ) and delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications .
0	what caused ww	The various categories of explanation for World War I correspond to different historians ' overall methods .
0	what caused ww	Most historians and popular commentators include causes from more than one category of explanation to provide a rounded account of the causes of the war .
0	what caused ww	The deepest distinction among these accounts is between stories that see it as the inevitable and predictable outcome of certain factors , and those that describe it as an arbitrary and unfortunate mistake .
0	what caused ww	In attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war .
0	what caused ww	Early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War '' were shown to be incomplete and biased .
0	what caused ww	In addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between Russia and France , were found to have been doctored .
0	what caused ww	Even in later decades however , when much more information had been released , historians from the same culture have been shown to come to differing conclusions on the causes of the war .

0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	A schematic presentation of the plum pudding model of the atom ; in Thomson 's mathematical model the `` corpuscles '' ( or modern electrons ) were arranged non-randomly , in rotating rings
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The current model of the sub-atomic structure involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic `` cloud '' of electrons
1	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The plum pudding model of the atom by J. J. Thomson , who discovered the electron in 1897 , was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic model .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In this model , the atom is composed of electrons ( which Thomson still called `` corpuscles '' , though G. J. Stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 ) surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons ' negative charges , like negatively charged `` plums `` surrounded by positively charged `` pudding `` .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The electrons ( as we know them today ) were thought to be positioned throughout the atom , but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons , particularly rotating rings of electrons ( see below ) .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Instead of a soup , the atom was also sometimes said to have had a `` cloud '' of positive charge .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	With this model , Thomson abandoned his earlier `` nebular atom '' hypothesis in which the atom was composed of immaterial vortices .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Now , at least part of the atom was to be composed of Thomson 's particulate negative corpuscles , although the rest of the positively charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and ill-defined .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The 1904 Thomson model was disproved by the 1909 gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	This was interpreted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge ( in the case of gold , enough to balance about 100 electrons ) , thus leading to the Rutherford model of the atom .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Although gold has an atomic number of 79 , immediately after Rutherford 's paper appeared in 1911 Antonius Van den Broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear charge .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The matter required experiment to decide .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Henry Moseley 's work showed experimentally in 1913 ( see Moseley 's law ) that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number ( Moseley found only one unit difference ) , and Moseley referenced only the papers of Van den Broek and Rutherford .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	This work culminated in the solar-system-like ( but quantum-limited ) Bohr model of the atom in the same year , in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Bohr had also inspired Moseley 's work .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Thomson 's model was compared ( though not by Thomson ) to a British dessert called plum pudding , hence the name .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Thomson 's paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine , the leading British science journal of the day .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In Thomson 's view : ... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , ...
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In this model , the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud , it felt a larger net positive inward force , because there was more material of opposite charge , inside its orbit ( see Gauss 's law ) .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In Thomson 's model , electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons , and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements , but was not notably successful at this .
0	when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Still , Thomson 's model ( along with a similar Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons , also put forward in 1904 by Nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell 's model of Saturn 's rings ) , were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like Bohr model of the atom .
